<p> Boxwood Bureau grew out of the award-winning environmental journalism project <a href="http://climateconfidential.com">Climate Confidential</a>. Co-founded by six independent journalists and funded by readers, Climate Confidential produced original, in-depth environmental journalism that was distributed across a wide network of partner websites, including The Atlantic, Quartz, Scientific American, Smithsonian, Popular Science, Modern Farmer, and more.</p>
 
 <p>In August 2014, Climate Confidential launched Local Edition, a ground-breaking series of environmental stories produced in partnership with local newspapers and community media. Highlights included <a href="http://putahcreeklegacy.com">a week-long multimedia series on the restoration of Putah Creek</a>, in Davis, Calif., and a collaboration with The Japan Times on a story examining the intersection of population decline and the environment. Local Edition is now a project of The Boxwood Bureau.</p>
